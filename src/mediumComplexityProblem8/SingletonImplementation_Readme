Q8. Program Write a singleton class

Description: Singleton class means you can create only one object for the given class.
You can create a singleton class by making its constructor as private,
so that you can restrict the creation of the object.
Provide a static method to get instance of the object,
wherein you can handle the object creation inside the class only.
In this example we are creating object by using static block.

Constructor will invoke for only one object
Hashcode of first object is :1705736037
Hashcode of Second object is :1705736037
'firstObj and secondObj' are equal so they are pointing to the same object
